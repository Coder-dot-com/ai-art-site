===Problem identification===
(don't assume known cause)
(most prospects think the symptoms are the problem)
(most associate the symptoms with the problem not the underlying cause)
(they probably don't know the root cause,)
(assume that the symptoms/pain are the problem)
(can go into root cause in the copy to explain how you'll solve the symptoms)
(is there an unaddressed root/real problem which can become your USP)
